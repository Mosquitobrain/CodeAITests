MODEL: Codellama 7B Q4_K_M by TheBloke
1:Write me a simple calculator program in Python that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
NOTES:
Honestly I am very satisfied with the first results. I would try to push for more but TBH I don't really see what I could do different.
2: Reject the input if the user attempts to divide by zero. Call them a "Naughty Pookie"
NOTES: Decided to add handling for dividing by zero. Also seeing if it can do *any* normal text handling. Appears not though.
